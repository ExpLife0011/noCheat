noCheat
=======
noCheat is a new approach on the constant defense against cheaters/hackers/botters in online games.

noCheat aims to create a web-based API in which game developers/players can interface to update/query a player's games, play times, statistics, videos/screenshots, and most importantly, their gaming legitimacy.

This repository contains the whole ordeal - both the Windows go-along application, as well as the web API.

**This repository will be set to private whenever I get the funds to do so. THIS IS NOT A PUBLIC PROJECT!**

*This project is led/programmed by Qix*
