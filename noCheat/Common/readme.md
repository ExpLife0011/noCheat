noCheat Common Lib
==================

This is where the magic happens.

The **noCheat Common Library** includes a lot of juicy, simple to use static functions to help any application/DLL system that is created under the noCheat project.

Firstly, you might as: **Can I use this code?**

The short answer is **NO!** Not unless you are apart of the noCheat Coding Team only.

If you believe you unrightfully have access to this repo, please notify **Qix** &lt;qix@lavabit.com> or one of the confirmed noCheat developers IMMEDIATELY.

The dangers of this code getting out to the public much past the Alpha stage are too great. While the code itself is fairly standard, it's the configuration of the encryption, API keys, etc. that are so vulnerable.

Otherwise, if you're entitled to view/use this code, have fun, and make sure to submit tickets for *even the smallest things (typos in comments, formatting suggestions, etc.*. I (Qix) personally *love* tickets, so the more the merrier :]
